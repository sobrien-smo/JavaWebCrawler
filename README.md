This project is a Java study that exercises its HTTP capabilities. This crawler will accept as many as three URLs at a time from the user and store the content of the website in the database provided by the user. Then when a search term is submitted, it returns the url it is found in.

Next steps: Use regex to be more specific about what content should be saved.
